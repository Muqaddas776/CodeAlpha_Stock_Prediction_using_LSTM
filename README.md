# STOCK PREDICTION USING LSTM

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a specialized type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to model and predict time-series data effectively. By leveraging historical stock price data, the model aims to forecast future stock prices, enabling users to gain insights into potential market trends and make more informed trading decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of historical stock prices for Microsoft Corporation (MSFT). The data is sourced from the Yahoo Finance API, which provides reliable and up-to-date stock market data, including open, high, low, close prices, and trading volume. This rich dataset serves as the foundation for training and testing the LSTM model.

## Project Objectives
Data Collection: Fetch historical stock prices for Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) using the Yahoo Finance API.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values and creating sequences for model input.
Model Building: Design and train an LSTM model capable of capturing temporal dependencies in the stock price data.
Prediction: Use the trained LSTM model to predict future stock prices and evaluate the model’s performance.
Visualization: Plot and visualize the predicted stock prices against actual prices to assess the model’s accuracy and reliability.

## Requirements

1. Python 3.x
2. Libraries:
3. TensorFlow/Keras
4. NumPy
5. Pandas
6. Matplotlib
7. Scikit-learn
8. yfinance

## Results
The model’s predictions will be output as graphs showing the comparison between actual and predicted stock prices for Microsoft Corporation (MSFT).

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of LSTM networks in predicting stock prices based on historical data. The use of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) data from Yahoo Finance showcases the practical application of LSTM in real-world stock market forecasting.
