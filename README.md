# STOCK PREDICTION USING LSTM

## Overview
This project is focused on predicting the stock prices of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The model uses historical stock data to forecast future prices, offering insights that can be valuable for investors and traders. The dataset is sourced from Yahoo Finance, and the project involves data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Key Points
1. Dataset: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) stock data sourced from Yahoo Finance.
2. Data Overview: Initial exploration using head(), info(), dtypes, describe(), and checking for missing values.
3. Data Visualization: Plotting the historical Close price to understand stock trends.
4. Data Preparation: Normalization and creating time-series sequences for LSTM input.
5. Model Building: Constructing, compiling, and training the LSTM model.
6. Prediction: Predicting stock prices on test data and evaluating performance.
7. Results Visualization: Plotting predicted prices against actual prices to assess model accuracy.

## Requirements

1. Python 3.x
Libraries:
2. TensorFlow/Keras
3. NumPy
4. Pandas
5. Matplotlib
6. Scikit-learn
7. yfinance

## Results
The modelâ€™s predictions will be output as graphs showing the comparison between actual and predicted stock prices for Microsoft Corporation (MSFT).

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of LSTM networks in predicting stock prices based on historical data. The use of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) data from Yahoo Finance showcases the practical application of LSTM in real-world stock market forecasting.
